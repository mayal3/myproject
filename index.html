        <p>As climate change news travels the world, it is captured in local headlines and streamlined by news agencies. Disasters and crises spark Wikipedia entries and resonate in social media postings. The coverage of typhoon Hagibis ranges from concerns about the scheduled Grand Prix Formula 1 to the cancelled Rugby world cup and its effects on the Italian team, in news outlets across Europe. In Japan, besides the expected cautionary articles and sharing of tips and tricks of how to prepare for this tremendous storm, Instagram posts include small messages of relief, of looking forward to the time that can be spent with family while hiding out from the typhoon. The storytelling platform presented here is inspired by such relatable local stories of the impact of climate change: everyday encounters with through drought, flood, storms, air pollution, migration, and typhoons. A monster approaches. </p>
